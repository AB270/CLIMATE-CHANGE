   <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE??</h1>
   <h3 style="font-size: 25px;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">Climate change describes a change in the average conditions — such as temperature and rainfall — in a region over a long period of time. For example, Climate change has a strong influence on the precipitation over the Himalayas as well as melting response of glaciers or snow cover in Himalayas. This, in turn, affects the runoff pattern of rivers draining from the glaciated catchments of Himalayas.Global climate change refers to the average long-term changes over the entire Earth. These include warming temperatures and changes in precipitation, as well as the effects of Earth’s warming, such as Rising sea levels Shrinking mountain glaciers Ice melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic Changes in flower and plant blooming times. Earth’s climate has constantly been changing — even long before humans came into the picture. However, scientists have observed unusual changes recently. For example, Earth’s average temperature has been increasing much more quickly than they would expect over the past 150 years.
